- **[IronClaw](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw)** - Privacy-first AI assistant built in Rust. All data stored locally with AES-256-GCM encryption. Credentials are injected at the host boundary and never exposed to tool code. Features WASM sandbox isolation, allowlist HTTP validation, content sanitization, rate limiting, and active leak detection scanning requests/responses for exfiltration attempts. Apache 2.0 / MIT licensed.

## AI Agent Credential Managers

## Key Concepts

| Pattern | Description |
|---|---|
| **Zero-Knowledge Credential Injection** | Secrets are encrypted and injected at runtime boundaries; LLMs never see raw credentials |
| **Brokered Credentials** | A secure middle layer makes API calls on behalf of agents; the LLM decides *what*, the broker handles *how* |
| **Workload Identity Attestation** | Agents authenticate via cryptographic proof of their runtime environment, eliminating static API keys |
| **Human-in-the-Loop Approval** | Credential access requires explicit human approval via secure channels |
| **Lease-Based Access** | Time-limited, automatically-expiring credentials scoped per agent |
| **MCP OAuth 2.1 + PKCE** | The emerging standard for AI agent authorization in MCP ecosystems |
